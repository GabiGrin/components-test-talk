- small disclaimer about typescript + funny footer about me thinking it's the bestzd + components architecture
- test example, 1 test -> is it bad?
- NO
- another example, 2 tests -> is it bad?
- Kind of
- another example, 4 tests -> is it bad
- VERY bad

- Why is it bad?
- Following the Rule of 3 - DRY, Separation of concerns, lack of abstraction

- Why is it bad #2?
- More typing, change of class? rewrite. Components using it will need to rewrite to

- Let's try improving it, refactor

- Improvement number 1

- Nice.. we can do better

- Improvement number 2

- That's more like it.

- Good refactoring leads to new design patterns!

- Device driver definition -> Component driver definition + explanation

- Advanced examples - nesting + drivers for all DOM elements

- Advanced example - change from angular to react without braking tests

- Additional benefits -> Creates an API for our components, making input and output clear

- Taking it into the next level - QA automation, adapters for other technologies

- Thank you
